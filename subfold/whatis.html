<p class="bold">„É°„É≥„Éò„É© (Menhera)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is Japanese internet slang for somebody who has, likely suffers from mental illness or needs&nbsp;</p>
<p>help for their mental illness.
  The term was seemingly popularized on 2Channel's&nbsp;</p>
<p>(now 5Channel as of late 2017) mental health board Menherer (now Menhera)&nbsp;</p>
<p>and was originally abbreviated as "Menhel", deriving from the word "mental health".&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It does not refer to any mental illness in specific but is moreso an ambiguous</p>
<p>&nbsp;term of nuance.
  Although Menhera is intentionally different from previous slurs and used to avoid discrimination,&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is still a stigma surrounding it.
  Being that Menhera are mentally unstable and their behavior can escalate very quickly:&nbsp;</p>
<p>stalking, throwing tantrums, attention-seeking, testing their partner's loyalty and threatening self harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the late 2010s, Menhera began to emerge in the form of a fashion through the substyle 'Yami Kawaii',&nbsp;</p>
<p>that would challenge Japanese society's views on mental health bluntly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pastel medical accessories like syringes, pins with nooses + pills and vent art on oversized clothing on full display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A series of satire comics by Bisuko Ezaki titled "Wrist cut warrior Menherachan/„É°„É≥„Éò„É©„ÉÅ„É£„É≥" that originally started off as vent</p>
<p>&nbsp;art became popularized through Yami Kawaii as well.
  
  The character has now become a staple in the fashion. However,&nbsp;</p>
<p>controversy arose when in early 2019, Ezaki trademarked the word 'Menhera'.
  
  It has since been bastardized as&nbsp;</p>
<p>only a 'sickly cute aesthetic' by westerners on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="bold">&nbsp;"Dating a menhera is already a hassle, imagine trying to break up with them"</p>
