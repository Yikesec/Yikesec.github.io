<p class="bold">ãƒ¡ãƒ³ãƒ˜ãƒ© (Menhera)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The origins of the Japanese net slang "menhera" can be traced back to the 1990s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time, there was a growing concern in Japan over the rising number of people suffering from mental health issues, including depression and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response, mental health clinics and support groups began to emerge, offering counseling and other forms of assistance to those in need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It was during this time that the term "menhera" first came into use. It was initially used by mental health professionals to describe patients who were&nbsp;</p>
<p>suffering from a range of mental health conditions. Over time, the term began to spread to the wider public,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and it became associated with a particular fashion and lifestyle trend.
  
  The menhera fashion trend emerged in the early 2000s,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and it was characterized by a dark and edgy aesthetic that often included bandages, medical supplies, and other symbols of death&nbsp;</p>
<p>and illness. The trend was embraced by a subculture of young people who identified with the struggles of those suffering from mental health issues.
  
  Today, the term menhera&nbsp;</p>
<p>has become a popular net slang term in Japan, used to describe both the fashion trend and the broader movement of people who</p>
<p>&nbsp;are working to raise awareness of mental health issues and break down the stigma that surrounds them. While the term is still&nbsp;</p>
<p>controversial in some circles, it has helped to bring attention to an important issue and has given a voice to those&nbsp;</p>
<p>who are struggling with mental health issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="bold">&nbsp;"Dating a menhera is already a hassle, imagine trying to break up with them"</p>
